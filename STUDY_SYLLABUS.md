## Week 1: Foundation Concepts (Days 1-7)

### Day 1: Insurance Fundamentals
**Study these concepts first** - everything else builds on them.

**App:** Quiz → Terms & Concepts (aim for at least 50% first pass)

**Core Concepts to Learn:**
1. **Insurable Interest** - You must have financial stake in what's insured
2. **Indemnity** - Insurance restores you to pre-loss position, not better
3. **Risk** - Chance of loss; insurance transfers risk

After each quiz session, read ALL lessons for questions you missed.

### Day 2: How Insurance Works
**App:** Continue Terms & Concepts until comfortable with basics

**Learn These:**
1. **Perils** = Causes of loss (fire, theft, wind)
2. **Hazards** = Conditions that increase risk
   - Physical hazard: icy sidewalk
   - Moral hazard: intentional dishonesty
   - Morale hazard: carelessness because insured
3. **Deductible** = Amount you pay before insurance kicks in
4. **Coinsurance** = Penalty for being underinsured

**MEMORIZE the coinsurance formula:**
```
Payment = (Amount Carried / Amount Required) × Loss
```

### Day 3: Loss Valuation & Negligence
**App:** Continue Terms & Concepts

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Actual Cash Value (ACV)** = Replacement Cost − Depreciation
2. **Replacement Cost** = Full cost to replace (no depreciation)
3. **Negligence** requires 4 elements: Duty, Breach, Causation, Damages

### Day 4: Contract Law Basics
**App:** Start Policy Provisions & Contract Law

**The 4 Elements of a Valid Contract:**
1. Offer and Acceptance
2. Consideration (premium for promise to pay)
3. Legal Purpose
4. Competent Parties (18+, mentally capable, licensed insurer)

**Insurance Contract Characteristics:**
- **Aleatory** = Unequal exchange based on chance
- **Unilateral** = Only insurer must perform
- **Conditional** = Insurer pays IF conditions met
- **Adhesion** = Take it or leave it (ambiguities favor insured)

### Day 5: Policy Structure
**App:** Continue Policy Provisions

**Every Policy Has These Parts:**
1. **Declarations** - Who, what, when, how much
2. **Insuring Agreement** - What's covered
3. **Conditions** - Duties of both parties
4. **Exclusions** - What's NOT covered
5. **Definitions** - What terms mean
6. **Endorsements** - Modifications

### Day 6: Claims & Subrogation
**App:** Continue Policy Provisions until 60%+ mastery

**Duties After Loss:**
- Give prompt notice

**Subrogation:** After paying your claim, insurer can sue whoever caused the loss

### Day 7: First Assessment

## Formulas to Know

### Coinsurance
```
Payment = (Amount Carried / Amount Required) × Loss
```
Example: Building worth $500K, 80% coinsurance, carry $300K, loss $100K
- Required: $500K × 80% = $400K
- Payment: ($300K / $400K) × $100K = $75K

### Actual Cash Value
```
ACV = Replacement Cost − Depreciation
```

## Exam Day Strategy
